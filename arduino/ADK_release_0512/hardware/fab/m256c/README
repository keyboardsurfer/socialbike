Board dimensions/outline included as zero width trace in silkscreen layer
for reference.  Board is made from 0.062" FR4 with 1oz copper on all
layers.  Minimum trace/space is 6/6 mils.

NOTE: Board contains 3 plated slots, each slot is marked at the two ends
and center with 0.041" drills.

Board layers stacked as follows:

     Top Silkscreen (Black)
     Top Soldermask (White)
     Top Copper (1oz)
     FR4 (62 mil)
     Bottom Copper (1oz)
     Bottom Soldermask (White)
     Bottom Silkscreen (Black)

Process the silkscreen layer against the soldermask layer to prevent
overlapping silkscreen on the pads through mask openings.
